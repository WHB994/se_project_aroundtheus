Project 3: Around The U.S.

Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
**Project description** This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Plan** Improve project for Sprint 4
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!

-Microphone stopped working have a new one ordered and will make a new video when that happens.

-In my video I show that for my sprint 3 project I have a Header at the top, profile section right below that, followed by the cards
    and the footer. On the cards I use display grid and a list on the card section.
